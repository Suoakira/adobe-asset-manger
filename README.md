## ADOBE Photoshop Asset Manager
Asset Manager for photoshop that makes dealing with images and importing files a breeze. No longer will you need to search around the web for beautiful royality free stock photos.

- **Frontend**: Vue, Vuex, Node.js, Scss, Adobe API, Quasar, Unsplash integration.

## Motivation
I wanted to solve a common problem creatives face using Adobe products. Would it not be great to have one file manager to rule them all? Sort, organise and save time! What if we could get access to fresh videos/images without having to leave Photoshop? Now we can! With Unsplash's integration, I allow users to search/import and find assets without the need to leave the project you are working on.
